## Roadmap üöÄ



# Current Sprint Tasks

| Status | Task |
|--------|------|
| ‚úÖ | Convert structured outputs to string outputs to reduce token usage |
| ‚úÖ | Increase image resolution for menu or fridge scans to 720px (from 256px) |
| ‚¨ú | Store meal responses in WatermelonDB and display them in a bottom sheet for the current date. Save meals but delete images with cronjob (optional) |
| ‚úÖ | Style the "Grant Permission" screen for better visuals and user experience |
| ‚úÖ | Change the navigation bar color to black and apply the glass effect from scanning buttons |
| ‚úÖ | Update the bottom sheet bar color to black |
| ‚¨ú | Implement a dynamic loading animation during meal scanning. Once the response is received, display results as fading-in/out pill-style elements, followed by the bottom bar appearing |
| ‚¨ú | Put health score in database, input/output and WatermelonDB |
| ‚¨ú | Put type of user, "FREE" "PREMIUM" or "ADMIN" (default: FREE) |
| ‚¨ú | Limit food scanning to 5 scans a day. After that show a modal: "Daily Scan Limit Reached" (same as permission screen, so make it a ui component to reuse) |
| ‚úÖ | Show animation loading while registering/login (DB + backend init). |
